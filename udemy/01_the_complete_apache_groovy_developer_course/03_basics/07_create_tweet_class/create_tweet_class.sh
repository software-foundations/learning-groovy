# Create a class called Tweet
# Add properties to this class.
# What properties would be present in a class that holds information about a tweet
# Think about what their data types would be
# What methods would go in this class?
# How about a constructor to create a new tweet.
# How about methods to change some of your properties?
# How about a toString method (or AST Transformation)
# Create a script called Twitter.
# In this script create one or more Tweets.
# print the Tweet instances to the console (and have their string representations shown)
